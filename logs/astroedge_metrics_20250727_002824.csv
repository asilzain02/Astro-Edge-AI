Streese is a word that has been around for centuries, but it's been gaining popularity in recent years. It's a slang term used to describe a feeling of being overwhelmed, exhausted, or overly stressed.

In the context of space travel, the term ""streese"" can be used to describe the feeling of being in isolation, surrounded by nothingness, and surrounded by unknowns. As an astronaut, you may feel a sense of isolation and disconnection from the rest of the world, but you are not alone in your mission.

Streese can also refer to the physical sensation of being in a confined space, whether it's a spacecraft or a space station. The feeling of confinement can be both exciting and terrifying, as you are surrounded by nothing but your own thoughts and memories.

In summary, streese is a word used to describe the feeling of being overwhelmed, exhausted, or overly stressed in space travel. It can refer to the physical sensation of confinement, as well as the psychological and emotional experience of being isolated and disconnected from the rest of the world.",6.7,1228.13
